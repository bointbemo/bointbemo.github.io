									<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
									<p>
										I am a physicist and programmer with a deep understanding of mathematics. Applying complex concepts to create models in C++ for my dissertation project, "Fluid Body Interactions in Video Games" where I applied Lagrangian fluid dynamics into an existing game engine, to produce a high performance real time fluid body system using compute shaders. Throughout my time studying at university I have also worked in multiple customer facing roles which, not only has taught me the importance of time management but also the importance of working effectively in a team to ensure service runs smoothly and efficiently. I believe this experience will come to bolster my effectiveness as a programmer,  working as part of a larger team where many different roles come together to work on a product.

									<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>
										<strong>Game Engineering- Newcastle University MSc</strong><br>
										<em>Newcastle University | Sep 2022 - Sep 2023: I am on track to achieve a distinction in this MSc</em>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Advanced Programming for Games: This module served as an introduction to C++ and coding by introducing all of the core aspects of C++ that would act as a backbone for everything to come. During this module I made my first program.</li>
										<li>Advanced Graphics for Games: Using OpenGL I was tasked with creating a fantasy scene. I found my previous study of Physics, particularly my proficiency in 3D math, valuable as this is an integral part of vertex manipulation.</li>
										<li>Advanced Game Technologies: In this module I worked to make a physics engine. Having come from a Physics background I found this extremely enjoyable to apply some of the skills I had learnt from my undergraduate degree in a practical way.</li>
										<li>Engineering Gaming Solutions within a Team: Currently working on a team project to make a Splatoon-like game. I am in the project focusing on graphics and cross-platform compatibility with PS4.</li>
										<li>Dissertation: Using my physics background I implemented Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics into the Newcastle University game engine, solving all fluid particle calculations in compute shaders and providing the ability for fluid bodies to act on rigid bodies. The simulation currently supports up to 7200 particles being rendered with forces being updated on the GPU achieving 240 frames per second in most scenarios.</li>
									</ul>
							
									<p>
										<strong>Physics BSc</strong><br>
										<em>Newcastle University | Sep 2018 - Sep 2021: 2:1</em>
									</p>
									<p>
										During my time studying Physics I developed a deep understanding of many different aspects of Mathematics and Physics. In my final year I focused my project on comparing computationally Nuclear bombs and Supernovae using Matlab.I further gained an understanding of statistical mathematics through my studies of quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics .

									<h2>Work Experience</h2>
									<p>
										<strong>Mother Mercy</strong><br>
										<em>Bartender, Mother Mercy Cloth Market, August 2022-present</em>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Top 50 UK cocktail bar with an incredibly high attention to detail and positive customer experience.</li>
										<li>An acute focus on ensuring all aspects of service are of the highest standard, Mistakes in this environment are taken seriously and is imperative to the reputation of the business that every customer experience is perfect, without exception.</li>
										<li>Joined an incredibly talented and knowledgeable team to learn more from some of the best bartenders in the industry to continue learning about mixology whilst also doing full-time university.</li>
										<li>Speed, reliability, and versatility under pressure is paramount. As the only part-time staff member to be trained in all sections of service, I am expected to be able to be dropped into any role during a shift and execute the role perfectly.</li>
									</ul>
							
									<p>
										<strong>Crafted projects</strong><br>
										<em>Multisite Bar Manager, Gunner Tavern and Central Oven and Shaker May 2021 – August 2022 (manager from March 2022)</em>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Managed two busy city center venues, one a cocktail bar the other a craft beer venue.</li>
										<li>In charge of all dry orders for both venues and wet orders and stock for Central Oven and Shaker.</li>
										<li>Performed safe counts, cash order collections, and end-of-night cash-ups.</li>
										<li>Solely responsible for all bar training and running shifts.</li>
										<li>Created and incorporated systems that dramatically influenced the overall efficiency of the bar; this included a complete overhaul in the bar set up and stock management in order to increase the amount of time bartenders had serving customers. This initiative led to a noticeable increase in weekend takings.</li>
										<li>One of the youngest managers in the company – I achieved this despite others being more experienced than myself due to my ability to seamlessly fit into any venue I had been sent to in a supervisory role and effectively lead teams of new people. Furthermore, upper management had a great deal of trust in my decision-making abilities to ensure any venue I worked in was running accordingly to the goal my general manager had laid out.</li>

								   <p>Using C++ and OpenGL</p>
								<p>Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)is an interpolation method which approximates and derives of continuous field quantities by using discrete sample points. The points are the said smooth particles that carry mass, position and velocity and also pressure, temperature and density. SPH can approximate derivates of continuous fields using analytical differentiation on particles located arbitrarily. i.e. does not have to be confined to a particular location in space. Using my physics background I implemented a SPH physics system into the Newcastle University game engine, solving all fluid particle calculations in compute shaders and providing the ability for fluid bodies to act on rigid bodies. the simulation currently supports up to 7200 particles being rendered with forces being updated on 
									the GPU achieving 240 frame per second in most scenarios.

								  <p>Using OpenGL and C++</p>
								<p>In this project that I completed during my university course, our task was to create a fantasy scene, using Elden Ring as an example game. I chose to challenge myself by attempting to create a mesmerizing graphical effect that would allow players to seemlessly move between two distinct areas through 'portal'. Firstly, I loaded two separate skyboxes and utilized a quad that reflected a skybox, ensuring that it reflected the skybox that wasn't being viewed by the camera. By inverting the two sides of the skybox that were orthogonal to the face of the quad, I was able to give the ability to 'look through' the quad and observe the skybox on the other side. I then split the heightmap in half, using the worldspace postion of each side of the 'portal' to determine what texture would be applied to the heightmap. To add to the overall portal effect, I blended the texture from being sampled on either side of the portal to the other, i then blended the textures in the shader, to create the illusion of the each side of the portal bleeding onto the other. A gargoyle can be seen stationed outside the portal, being slightly transparent and being renderered with random in movements a small confined area. Finally there are some trees that are culled when they arent being looked at.</p>

							  <p>Using C++, OpenGL and PS4 SDK
							<p>During the second semester I took part in a team project to recreate the game SplatToon, by the end of this project my team became the 2nd team in the courses’ history to create a fully working game in all aspects that were assigned by the professors, and the first team to do so by making a 3D game. My role particularly in this project was to be responsible for integrating a Playstation 4 version of the game. Using the Playstion 4 SDK I rewrote the renderer to help allow the game to run on Playstion 4 as well as using cMAKE to get all other parts of the game to work cross-platform. Throughout this project there was a focus especially on ensuring the scope and objectives we had set were achievable within the limited timeframe.</p>
